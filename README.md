# MultiAgentResearchApp

A team of AI agents that collaboratively execute company research, using Tavily and LangGraph.

Notes to self: 
- gather strong web sources for finding information about company
- if agents run different parts of the research in parallel, make sure to synthesize and avoid content overlap.
- keep it modular so that individual agents can be interacted with.

## Part 1: Develop a Multi-Agent Application

**Objective:** Develop a team of AI agents that collaboratively execute company research using
cutting-edge frameworks and APIs. This should involve a detailed analysis of companies based
on user-specified criteria.

### Project Overview and Goals:
● Design: Assemble a team of agents/LangGraph nodes that collaborate to perform
comprehensive company research. Ensure each agent/node can handle its specific tasks
effectively and contribute to the collective goal.
● Application: The agents should provide insights such as company background,
financial health, market position, and recent news.
Frameworks and APIs:
● LangGraph: Utilize the LangGraph framework to design the workflow and interaction
of AI agents.
● Tavily API: Use the Tavily API to access data efficiently, integrating concepts of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into your agents' operations. Contact support if
you're running low on credits.

### Publication and Documentation:
● GitHub Repository: Publish your complete project on GitHub. Include thorough
setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
● Documentation: Offer detailed documentation on the project's objectives,
architecture, API integration, and example outputs.
Evaluation Criteria:
● Functionality: Effective collaboration among agents to achieve the research goal.
● Creativity: Originality in application design and agent task execution.
● Code Quality: Well-organized, documented, and maintainable code.
Motivation: This assignment challenges you to apply advanced AI frameworks in a practical,
real-world application. It's a chance to demonstrate your skills in AI development and
potentially contribute to Tavily’s growing team. We aim to foster a community that values innovative thinking and collaboration.


Part 2: Deploy the Agent on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and MongoDB Atlas with a
Simple UI
Objective: Deploy the multi-agent application developed in Part 1 to AWS Elastic Beanstalk,
utilizing MongoDB Atlas as the database service. Create a user-friendly interface to interact with
the agents.
Deployment Overview and Steps:
● AWS Elastic Beanstalk Setup:
○ Configure the Elastic Beanstalk environment suitable for a Python-based
application.
○ Ensure the environment supports multiple instances to facilitate the
collaboration of AI agents.
● MongoDB Atlas Integration:
○ Create a cluster in MongoDB Atlas to store and manage data accessed and
generated by the AI agents.
○ Integrate the database with the application using the MongoDB Python client to
store results and logs of the agents’ activities.
● UI Development:
○ Develop a simple web-based user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
○ The UI should allow users to input search criteria, initiate the research process,
and display results in a readable format.
● Connection and Testing:
○ Ensure all components of the application are properly connected, including the
interface, backend logic, AWS services, and MongoDB Atlas.
○ Conduct thorough testing to verify that the agents work collaboratively and the
application handles requests and displays data correctly.
● Deployment:
○ Deploy the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
○ Utilize AWS’s monitoring tools to track the application’s performance and adjust
resources as necessary.
● Documentation and Publication:
○ Document the deployment process, including environment configuration,
dependencies, and steps for replicating the deployment.
○ Update the GitHub repository with the deployment guide and any additional
resources needed for setting up the application.
